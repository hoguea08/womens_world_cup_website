				<h2>The Beginning</h2>
				<p>The first official FIFA Women's World Cup was held in 1991, hosted by China. This, however,
				was not the first Women's World Cup - Italy paved the way in 1970 with the Coppa Del Mondo, in
				which seven countries participated. Mexico then held another Women's World Cup, the Campeonato
				de Futbol Femenil, a year later in 1971. This tournament featured six teams and drew a high
				number of spectators due to interest after the men's World Cup. Various "mundialitos" were
				played throughout the 1980s until FIFA held an "Invitation Tournament" in 1988 to gauge
				interest in an official women's World Cup. The success of this tournament led to the beginning
				of the FIFA Women's World Cup in 1991 in which 12 teams participated. Many great football
				players who would go on to make history played in the first World Cup, including Mia Hamm,
				Michelle Akers, April Heinrichs, and Sun Wen. The Women's World Cup - played every four years -
				grew in popularity, hitting over 1.1 million fans attending the matches in 1999.</p>
